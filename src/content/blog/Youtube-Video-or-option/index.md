That they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights. For the men and women of Reverend Wright's generation, the memories of humiliation and doubt and fear have not gone away; nor has the anger and the bitterness of those years. We measure the strength of our economy not by the number of billionaires we have or the profits of the Fortune 500, but by whether someone with a good idea can take a risk and start a new business, or whether the waitress who lives on tips can take a day off to look after a sick kid without losing her job - an economy that honors the dignity of work.

And we should close Guantanamo Bay and stop tolerating the torture of our enemies. "People began to shout, to rise from their seats and clap and cry out, a forceful wind carrying the reverend's voice up into the rafters....And in that single note - hope! - I heard something else; at the foot of that cross, inside the thousands of churches across the city, I imagined the stories of ordinary black people merging with the stories of David and Goliath, Moses and Pharaoh, the Christians in the lion's den, Ezekiel's field of dry bones. But if we do, I can tell you that in the next election, we'll be talking about some other distraction. Change comes to Washington. I am also proud to carry with me the goodwill of the American people, and a greeting of peace from Muslim communities in my country: assalaamu alaykum. For centuries, black people in America suffered the lash of the whip as slaves and the humiliation of segregation.

This year, in this election, we are called to reaffirm our values and our commitments, to hold them against a hard reality and see how we are measuring up, to the legacy of our forbearers, and the promise of future generations. It got hijacked. Because that was the cheapest way to eat. It's because John McCain doesn't get it. America will not turn our backs on the legitimate Palestinian aspiration for dignity, opportunity, and a state of their own.

They are both passed away now. This country is more generous than one where a man in Indiana has to pack up the equipment he's worked on for twenty years and watch it shipped off to China, and then chokes up as he explains how he felt like a failure when he went home to tell his family the news.

A belief in things not seen. But we do need to remind ourselves that so many of the disparities that exist in the African-American community today can be directly traced to inequalities passed on from an earlier generation that suffered under the brutal legacy of slavery and Jim Crow. It will be hard to overcome decades of mistrust, but we will proceed with courage, rectitude and resolve.

It is not enough to give health care to the sick, or jobs to the jobless, or education to our children. Because one of the things that we have to change in our politics is the idea that people cannot disagree without challenging each other's character and patriotism. To play a role in fulfilling Palestinian aspirations, and to unify the Palestinian people, Hamas must put an end to violence, recognize past agreements, and recognize Israel's right to exist.

And until we stop the genocide that's being carried out in Darfur as I speak, our conscience cannot rest. America, this is one of those moments. Indeed, faith should bring us together.

Thank you, and God bless America.
